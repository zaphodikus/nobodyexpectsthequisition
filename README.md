Python typewriter invisible typist movies. Makes video from a text message showing keys tapping realistically. Monty Python reference, [nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9jBPBqIUL4).

Various typewriter sounds randomly create realistic typewritter tapping noises that correspond with ghost typing key presses. Requires FFmpeg to convert the images to movie (code is included, to do this for windows, may work on posix with minimal mods). Or manualyl convert images using a digital movie editor (ffmpeg is just less fuss.)

Note, this is a **just-works** tm Pyton script, not intended to work with your own typewriter unless you do a little bit of work to correctly position masks.
